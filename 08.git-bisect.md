# Git bisect

- Binary search for bugs
- It's the most effective way to find the exact commit that broke the code
- Instead of checking every commit one by one (`linear search`), `git bisect` splits the history in half
- Tell git which version is bad and which is good, git picks a commit in the middle for you to test
  - 7 steps to find a bug in 100 commits

```bash
git bisect start # start the search
git bisect bad # mark current version as broken
git bisect good <hash> # mark a known working version

# git will checkout to a commit in the middle
# test the code and then
git bisect bad # if bug is present
git bisect good # if bug is absent

# to finish and go back to original branch
git bisect reset
```
