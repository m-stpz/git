# Git stash

- The pause button

## The core workflow

1. `git stash`: your dirty changes are "saved" and removed from your working directory
   - your repo is now clean
2. Do other work: switch branches, pull changes, or run tests
3. `git stash pop`: the play button
   - git brings back your unsaved changes and reapplies them to your current branch
   - then deletes your stash entry

## The `-u` flag

- By default, `git stash` only saves tracked files (files git knows about)
- If you created a file and haven't `git add` it yes, a normal stash won't save it

```bash
git stash -u # untracked: ensures everything you worked on is moved into the stash
```

## Managing the stack

- We're not limited to one stash. We can have a whole list of them

```bash
git stash list
git stash save 'description' # stash with a name
git stash apply # applies the changes, but differently from pop, it doesn't delete them from the stash
```
